libgc
------------------------------------------
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you to
allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly
deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer
be otherwise accessed.

The collector is also used by a number of programming language
implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want to
facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the
simple collector interface.

Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a leak detector for
C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.

Build instructions:
  unpack libgc-7.1-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./libgc-7.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libgc-7.1-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libgc-devel-7.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libgc1-7.1-X.tar.bz2
